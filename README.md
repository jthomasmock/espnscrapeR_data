# espnscrapeR_data

Data repo companion to my [`{espnscrapeR}`](https://jthomasmock.github.io/espnscrapeR/) package.

**Note that for much of this data, you can join against `nflfastR` via Lee Sharpe's [nfldata repo](https://github.com/leesharpe/nfldata)**

If you're looking for general NFL data, check out Lee's [NFL Game Data site](http://nflgamedata.com/schedule.php).

For `nflfastR` proper, you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR). 

There's also the [rbsdm.com](https://rbsdm.com/) site that has lots of advanced analytics and boxscores.
